**Senior Design Project**

\
The aim of this repository:

This project is developed using C#, Asp.Net Core, Repository Design Pattern, and Onion Architecture technologies. The main aim of the project is to handle intense requests from users as a backend and as a part of Software architecture, project is designed with onion architecture. Thanks to this architecture, the project can be easily changed in necessary cases. Also, I implemented a Repository design pattern to easily develop database entities. 

I will also add some links that I thought useful for learning React.
